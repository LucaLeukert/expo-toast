## `success`

Use for completed actions and positive outcomes.

```ts
toast.success('Changes saved');
```

## `error`

Use for failures that need user awareness.

```ts
toast.error('Could not save changes');
```

## `info`

Use for neutral updates and status messages.

```ts
toast.info('Sync started in background');
```

## `loading`

Use for long-running actions. Loading toasts default to infinite duration until transitioned or dismissed.

```ts
const id = toast.loading('Importing contacts...');

// Later
toast.update(id, { variant: 'success', message: 'Import complete', duration: 'short' });
```

## Variant selection rules of thumb

- Prefer `success` for finished, user-triggered operations.
- Prefer `error` for operations that failed and may need follow-up.
- Prefer `info` for passive state changes.
- Prefer `loading` when you expect a later completion state.
