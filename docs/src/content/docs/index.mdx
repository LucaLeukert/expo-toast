description: What expo-toast is, when to use it, and how the docs are organized.

`expo-toast` is an Expo module that gives you a native-feeling toast system with a simple TypeScript API.

It is designed for production apps that need:

- Fast feedback for user actions (`Saved`, `Upload failed`, `Copied`)
- Consistent toast behavior across screens
- Queueing, dedupe, and update-in-place flows
- Accessibility-aware announcements and motion handling

## Runtime support

- iOS native runtime: supported
- Android and web: safe no-op API (`toast.isSupported()` returns `false`)

## How to use these docs

- [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started): install and first toast
- [Using the Toast Module](/guides/using-toast-module): core API patterns
- [Toast Variants](/guides/toast-variants): `success`, `error`, `info`, `loading`
- [Configuration](/guides/configuration): defaults, queueing, dedupe, motion, accessibility
- [API Reference](/reference/api): complete generated reference from JSDoc

## Design goals

- API-first: call `toast` from anywhere in app logic
- Predictable: global defaults + per-toast overrides
- Safe by default: unsupported platforms do not crash
